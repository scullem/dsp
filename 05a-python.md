# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

>> Lists and tuples are both sequence types, and can be used with similar types of operations. They can both contain values of any type (integer, float, string, etc.), and they are indexed by integers.
>>
>>There is one major difference between lists and tuples that is inherent to the two different sequence types. Tuples are immutable (cannot be modified once created) and lists are mutable (can be modified). So you canâ€™t delete or sort tuples once created. Because they are immutable, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot. A dictionary requires that a key be "hashable". The hash function takes any kind of value and returns an integer that is used to store and look up its key-value pairs. If keys were permitted to be mutable, this could create problems in terms of recording location. As such, lists can be used as values in dictionaries but not keys.
>>
>>Because of this inherent difference, they are used somewhat differently in practice:
>>
>>* Their elements are typically accessed by different methods. Tuples are typically accessed by unpacking their elements, where lists are typically (not always) accessed by iterating over the list.
* Lists are usually homogenous (although they are able to contain mixtures of data types), and tuples are typically heterogeneous (the different entries have different meanings). 
 * For example, where a list n = [1,2] might refer to a set of numbers, a tuple n = (1,2) might refer to the x-y coordinates of a location. In this case, the order (although we may care about order) of the numbers in the list can be changed without changing the meaning of each number, whereas changing the order of the numbers of the tuple would change the meaning.
* Tuples are typically handled as a coherent unit, whereas the elements of a list are often dealt with individually

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>> Lists and sets are similar in that they are both mutable, can support some of the same operations (sum(), len(), in, etc.) and can contain a mix of data types. 
>> 
>> Their key differences are as follows:
* Lists can contain any type of object, where sets can only contain objects that are hashable. This means a set cannot contain lists, dictionaries or other sets as its elements because they are all mutable (unless the set is a frozen set)
* Lists can contain duplicate elements, where sets cannot contain duplicates
* Lists are ordered, where sets are unordered
Sets allow operations from math set theory like intersection, union, difference
* Lists are accessed via indexes, where sets are accessed via hash tables
>> 
>> Lists are appropriate in cases with the following requirements:
* Need a collection of data all in one place, especially if you want to mix types of objects or accept any type of object.
* Need data to be ordered
* Need to modify or extend the data (add, remove, replace elements). For example, if you need a stack or a queue, lists can be easily manipulated to add/remove from the beginning or end of a list.
* Do not need data to be indexed by a custom value (like a key in a dictionary). Lists have a numeric index and the numeric position is required to retrieve an element.
* Do not need/want data to be unique. 
>> 
>> Sets are appropriate in cases with the following requirements:
* Need a unique set of data. Sets check the uniqueness of elements based on hashes, and will remove duplicates when creating a set object is created.
* Expect data to change. Sets are mutable.
* Need to perform mathematical operations like difference, union, intersection, etc.
* Do not need to store nested lists, sets, or dictionaries in a data structure. These are all mutable and therefore not hashable.

## Need to give examples and explain the performance finding an element
